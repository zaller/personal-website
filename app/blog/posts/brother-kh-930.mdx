Recently, I acquired a Brother KH-930 knitting machine 
([see manual](https://isabelzaller.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/brother_kh930-kh940_user_guide.pdf)). 
After watching a couple of YouTube videos, I felt confident enough to try my hand at making a few test 
swatches out of different materials at different gauges.

## Swatches
See below for descriptions of the swatches I created for several different yarns 
I had on hand. Hover over (or click) the images for quick descriptions of the 
number of needles cast on and the machine tension setting.

## Learnings

#### Machine knitting is FAST
I was blown away by how quickly the machine knits. As someone used to spending time 
on the order of minutes to hand-knit a single row, it was wild to see the machine "printing"
fabric. I am excited by the possibility for faster iteration that this will unlock.

#### Casting on/off with waste yarn
I initially used the e-wrap cast-on method and experimented casting off with both 
the loop through bind-off and the sewing bind-off. I found that it was far easier 
to cast on and off using waste yarn, single-crocheting the edges, and then unraveling 
the waste yarn. This was much faster, especially for casting off.

#### Yarn weight for machine vs. hand knitting
The optimal yarn weight for machine knitting differs notably from hand knitting. 
While I typically prefer DK weight yarns for hand knitting and rarely work with 
super bulky options, machine knitting requires much finer yarns, which was initially 
intimidating for me -- in hand knitting, a fine yarn means a final piece will take a long time to complete. 
However, the machine's rapid knitting speed more than compensates for using lighter weight yarns.
