      <h1 className="font-semibold text-2xl mb-8 tracking-tighter">About</h1>
		<p className="mb-4">
			I'm a software engineer who thrives at the intersection of digital systems and 
			physical-world applications. With a Princeton education and 2.5 years of experience 
			at Atlassian, I've developed a deep appreciation for how technology can transform 
			creative processes and enable new forms of expression.
			<br/><br/>
			My journey as a builder began in traditional software engineering, but quickly 
			expanded into the world of fiber arts. What started as an interest in crochet—seeing 
			it as an intriguing manifestation of algorithms in the physical world—evolved into a 
			broader exploration of how technology can enhance creative processes. This perspective 
			led me to machine knitting with the Brother KH-930, where I discovered the power of 
			automation in amplifying creative potential.
			<br/><br/>
			Currently, I'm developing a platform that bridges the gap between creative vision and 
			technical execution in knitwear design. This project exemplifies my passion for 
			building software that has tangible, real-world applications. By automating complex 
			pattern calculations, I'm working to free designers to focus on what truly matters: 
			innovation and creativity.
			<br/><br/>
			My background spans both coasts—from San Diego roots to San Francisco tech scene 
			experience, and now New York City's dynamic environment. This geographical journey 
			mirrors my professional evolution: always seeking new challenges and opportunities 
			to create meaningful impact through technology.
			<br/><br/>
			I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of software, robotics, and embedded 
			systems—areas where code transcends the digital realm to create meaningful physical 
			impact. My journey from traditional software development to exploring automated 
			manufacturing processes with knitwear has reinforced my passion for building systems 
			that bridge the digital-physical divide. Whether it's streamlining development 
			workflows at Atlassian or creating automated solutions for manufacturing processes, 
			I'm driven by opportunities to develop technology that solves tangible, real-world 
			problems.
